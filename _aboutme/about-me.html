  Hey everyone! I'm a <strong>Senior</strong> at <strong>Cornell University</strong>,
  majoring in <strong>Computer Science</strong> in the College of Engineering <br> <br>
  I love to <a href="https://github.com/navinramsaroop">code</a>, play sports
  (basketball and <a href="http://jpsaos.com/jpsoccer/images/2016_Varsity_Team/IMG_1301.JPG">soccer </a>),
  and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myFeFlaPfpU">sing</a>!
  This past summer, I worked at Squarespace where I worked on critical tickets
  to officially launch Squarespace as a Domain Registrar. My previous summer, I
  worked at Roblox where I constructed a Hashicorp Vault connection for the company servers
  to securely store and access the thousands of API keys and passwords.
